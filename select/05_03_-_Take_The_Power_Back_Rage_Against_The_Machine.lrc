[00:13.59] Crank the music up
[00:34.33] Bring that shit in
[00:37.30] Ugh
[00:44.46] Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
[00:48.79] Now check this out
[00:51.17] Ugh
[00:52.67] 
[00:53.49] In the right light, study becomes insight
[00:55.54] But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
[00:58.20] So-called facts are fraud
[00:59.81] They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
[01:02.49] Lost the culture, the culture lost
[01:05.31] Spun our minds and through time
[01:07.72] Ignorance has taken over
[01:09.80] Yo, we gotta take the power back
[01:12.23] Bam, here's the plan
[01:13.86] Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back I know who I am
[01:16.50] Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
[01:19.22] It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
[01:21.22] The rage is relentless
[01:23.35] We need a movement with a quickness
[01:25.62] You are the witness of change and to counteract
[01:28.56] We gotta take the power back
[01:42.56] 
[01:32.50] Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[01:37.09] C'mon, c'mon
[01:42.05] We gotta take the power back
[01:56.05] 
[01:47.88] The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
[01:50.09] Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
[01:52.35] See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
[01:54.54] With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
[01:56.94] Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
[01:59.74] We've got to take it back
[02:01.44] Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
[02:03.58] One-sided stories for years and years and years
[02:06.24] I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
[02:08.31] Yeah, we need to check the interior
[02:10.27] Of the system that cares about only one culture
[02:12.52] And that, is why we gotta take the power back
[02:35.02] 
[02:17.52] Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[02:22.24] C'mon, c'mon
[02:26.76] We gotta take the power back
[02:34.27] Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
[02:40.09] Awww shit
[02:49.88] Ugh
[02:51.38] 
[03:16.12] And like this
[03:19.32] Ugh
[03:21.58] C'mon
[03:24.28] Yeah
[03:25.50] Bring it back the other way
[03:28.40] Ugh
[03:29.90] 
[03:31.46] The teacher stands in front of the class
[03:33.33] But the lesson plan he can't recall
[03:35.66] The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
[03:37.72] Bouncing off every fucking wall
[03:40.35] His composure is well kept
[03:42.15] I guess he fears playing the fool
[03:44.78] The complacent students sit
[03:46.37] And listen to some of that bullshit that he learned in school
[03:49.26] Europe ain't my rope to swing on
[03:51.47] Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
[03:54.16] (Gotta get it, gotta get it together then)
[03:56.12] (Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
[03:58.01] Expose and close the doors on those who try
[04:00.35] To strangle and mangle the truth
[04:02.54] 'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
[04:05.78] We gotta take the power back
[04:19.78] 
[04:09.85] Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[04:14.39] C'mon, c'mon
[04:18.82] We gotta take the power back
[04:32.82] 
[04:45.48] No more lies
[04:48.03] No more lies
[04:50.28] No more lies
[04:52.55] No more lies
[04:54.93] No more lies
[04:57.37] No more lies
[04:59.78] No more lies
[05:01.95] No more lies
[05:04.07] Ugh
[05:08.37] Yeah
[05:10.37] 
[05:12.56] Take it back y'all
[05:14.16] Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back y'all! C'mon
[05:17.22] Take it back y'all
[05:18.59] Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back y'all! C'mon
[05:21.53] Ugh, yeah
