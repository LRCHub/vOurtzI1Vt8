[00:45.68] I sucked the moon, I spoke too soon
[01:17.96] And how much did it cost?
[01:30.46] 
[01:33.29] I was dropped from moonbeams
[01:48.57] And sailed on shooting stars
[02:02.57] 
[02:17.26] Maybe you'll be president
[02:32.88] But know right from wrong
[02:45.38] 
[02:47.14] Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
[03:03.42] And sail us to the moon
[03:14.92] 
[03:17.82] Sail us to the moon
[03:32.18] Sail to the moon
